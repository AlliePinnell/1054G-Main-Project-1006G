**Interface Design Using CSS & Introduction to Web Programming Using PHP**

# Main Project

## Selling Out!

**Due: Apr 2 by 11:59pm**

## Description:

This project will require you to create a professional interface and create a
functional CRUD system. Some ideas for your application (but not limited to):

- An application that allows a user to purchase a product.
- Your version of a social media platform
- An inventory system that allows the administration to manage products, or
  employees.

The mark for this project will be shared for both your interface class and your
web programming class, so you will need to make sure you focus on both the
front-end and the backend of this project. You may also work in pairs or solo for
this project.

## Instructions:

Please read and follow the instructions below carefully:

Design:

1. Decide on the product that you wish to sell. This can be any product real
   or fake!
2. Gather any images or text that will be needed for the design & website.
3. Create an accurate wireframe/design for the homepage (the index file).

Build (HTML):

1. The page should be created using the appropriate semantic elements
   and should be error free when validated.
2. Include all the required metadata.
3. Using valid HTML and the correct semantic elements, create the following
   public pages (no login required).
   a. Homepage
   b. About Page
   c. Register Page
   d. Login Page

Make it work (PHP):

1. Create a global header that contains a logo, login form and site
   navigation.
2. Create a global footer.
3. Add the create functionality to the register page.
   a. Passwords should be hashed.
   b. All inputs must be validated.
   c. Users should not be able to have the same email address.
   d. Upload an image.
4. Create an admin section to the website that will display all the registered
   users. **This page should require the user to be logged in**. The user should
   also be able to update or delete a registered user.
5. On the content page, **if the user is logged in** , they should be able to
   preform some CRUD functionality to the website's content.

SQL:

1. Create a table to contain the admin data.
2. Create a table to contain the website's content.

Style It (CSS):

1. The website should have a professional finish.
2. The CSS should be error free when validated.
3. The color scheme should complement the product and follow one of the
   following:
   a. Monochrome
   b. Complementary
   c. Analogous
   d. Or Triadic
4. The text should have at least 2 types of font families.

   enhancements, some ideas:
   a. Hover effects
   b. Background video / images
   c. SVGâ€™s
   d. Filters
   e. Etc.
